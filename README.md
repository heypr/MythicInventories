## MythicInventories â€” MC 1.20.6+
A simple way to go about generating inventories for MythicMobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The one and only dependency is [MythicMobs](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/mythicmobs.1/), however the plugin can be used without it, the mm_skill option will just not work.

## Download
You can download the latest version of MythicInventories [here](https://ci.heypr.dev/job/MythicInventories/).

## Support
If you're having difficulty figuring out how to work with the plugin, need to report a bug, or are interested in 
contributing to the project, please [join my support Discord](https://discord.gg/Drgk3CxrtV/)!

## Usage
Making inventories is pretty simple. All you need to do is open up the MythicInventories folder, create a .yml file with a name of your choice, then create one! 
> [!NOTE]
> This plugin supports [MiniMessage](https://github.com/Minevictus/MiniMessage/blob/master/DOCS.md). Go crazy with colors!

Here's a basic layout for an inventory that you could make:
```denizenscript
my_first_inventory:
  name: "<green>My <blue>Epic &cInventory"
  size: 45
  items:
    - name: "<black>"
      type: black_stained_glass_pane
      fill_item: true
    - name: "<red>Summon lightning strike"
      type: skeleton_skull
      slot: 23
      lore:
      - "<red>lorem ipsum something something"
      - "<blue>Woo: <gradient>||||||||||||||||||||||||</gradient>!"
      mm_skill: lightning_skill
      click_type: shift_left_click
      save: false
      interactable: false
```

## Options

- The `name` option is for setting the name of the inventory or the item. It is not required on either. If not set 
  on the inventory, the name will default to "Container" & if not set on the item, it will default to the item's
  material type.


- The `size` option is for setting the size of the inventory. It is optional, and should be a multiple of 9 and 
  greater than 0. If it is not specified, it will be set to 9 by default.


- The `items` option is for setting the items in the inventory. Ideally you should add items to your inventory.


- The `type` option is for setting the material type of the item. It is required.


- The `slot` option is for setting the slot of the item. It is required.


- The `lore` option is for setting the lore of the item. It is optional.


- The `gui` option is for setting whether all items in the inventory can be picked up and manipulated. It is `true` by 
default. Do note, that enabling this option will *not* allow players to modify anything in the inventory unless 
explicitly set through the `interactable` option (see below).


- The `fill_item` option is for items that need to fill the inventory. It is `false` by default, and is optional. 
  Please note that only one item can be a fill item.


- The `interactable` option is for setting whether the item can be picked up and manipulated. It is `false` by 
default, and is optional.


- The `save` option is for setting whether the item should be saved. It is `false` by default, and is optional.


- The `click_type` option is for setting the click type for the item. It is not set by default, and is optional.
Make sure to set this value to a valid click type if you want a skill to be executed when the item is clicked.
Valid click types are as follows: 
  - `LEFT_CLICK`
  - `RIGHT_CLICK`
  - `SHIFT_LEFT_CLICK`
  - `SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK`
  - `MIDDLE_CLICK`
  - `SHIFT_MIDDLE_CLICK`
  - `DROP`
  - `HOTBAR_SWAP`


- The `item_flags` option is for setting flags on the item. It is empty by default, and is optional.
Valid values for item flags are as follows:
  - `HIDE_ENCHANTS`,
  - `HIDE_ATTRIBUTES`,
  - `HIDE_UNBREAKABLE`,
  - `HIDE_DESTROYS`,
  - `HIDE_PLACED_ON`,
  - `HIDE_ADDITIONAL_TOOLTIP`,
  - `HIDE_DYE`,
  - `HIDE_ARMOR_TRIM`,
  - `HIDE_STORED_ENCHANTS`;
